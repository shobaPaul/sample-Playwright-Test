Purpose:
The script uses Playwright to automate a browser and scrape the timestamps of the first 100 articles from the "newest" page of Hacker News, then checks if these articles are sorted from newest to oldest.

Detailed Logic:
Setup and Launch:

Import and Launch:
Import the chromium module from Playwright.
Launch a Chromium browser instance in non-headless mode for visibility.
Create a new browser context and page to isolate the session and avoid cross-session contamination.

Navigate and Initialize:
Navigation:
Navigate to the "newest" page of Hacker News to start scraping from the latest articles.
Initialization:
Initialize articleTimes to store the timestamp data of articles.
Initialize articlesCount to track the number of articles processed.

Collect Articles:
Loop Until 100 Articles:
Wait for Articles to Load:
Wait for the presence of article elements (.athing). If it takes too long (more than 60 seconds), log an error, take a screenshot for debugging, and close the browser.
Extract Timestamps:
Extract the IDs and timestamps of the articles on the current page using DOM manipulation.
If an error occurs during extraction, log an error, take a screenshot, and close the browser.
Update Article List:
Append the new articles to articleTimes.
Update articlesCount with the current number of collected articles.
Check Article Count:
If the count reaches 100 or more, exit the loop.
Load More Articles:
Click the "More" button to load additional articles. If the button is not found, log an error and break the loop.
Wait for 2 seconds to ensure the new articles are loaded.

Post-Processing:
Trim to 100 Articles:
Slice articleTimes to keep only the first 100 articles if more were collected.
Check Sorting:
Verify that the articles are sorted from newest to oldest by comparing the timestamps sequentially.
Log whether the articles are sorted correctly.
Cleanup:

Close Browser:
Close the browser to end the session and release resources.
Error Handling:
If waiting for articles or extracting timestamps fails, log the error and take a screenshot for debugging purposes.
Ensure the browser is closed in case of errors to avoid leaving hanging processes.
The script ensures robust handling of potential errors while automating the scraping process and validating the order of the collected data.
